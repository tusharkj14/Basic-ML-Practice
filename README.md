# Basic-ML-Practice
Just me trying my best in Machine Learning using Python

02-April : Kaggle titanic datasets - extracted titles from the name and acheived an accuracy of nearly 80%.

05-April : MNIST dataset - nothing good achieved.

07-April : California Housing Dataset - SGD regressor blew my mind.

10-April : Basic EDA on a movie dataset.
